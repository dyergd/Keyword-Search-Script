# Keyword-Search-Script


The search keywords script was created my sopohmore year for my Unix fundamentals class.

The script searches a text file full of tweets based on a keyword the user determines. The script then creates a folder named after the search term and fills the folder with text files that contain the search term.

The script has 2 options. 

  The first option allows the user to run the script with a single search term. It also allows the user to search for two terms at once. If the user searches for two      terms the script creates a separate folder for each search term.
  
  The second option, -all also allows the user to search for two terms. The script then creates a folder named after both search terms for example, "term1_term2". The folder is then populated with text files that contain either search term
